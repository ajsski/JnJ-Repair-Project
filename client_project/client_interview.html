		<dt>What is your project's budget?&nbsp;</dt>

	<h3>&nbsp;Project Design and Specs&nbsp;</h3>
	   <dl>
		<dt>Is this site new or a refresh? Do you have a URL currently? If yes, please paste link into document.</dt>
		<dd>This is a refresh of a current business site. <br>
		https://www.jandjrepair.com/</dd>
	  <dt>How many pages will this site have? Do you have names for these pages specified?</dt>
		<dd>Five. Please keep current structure. Home/About Us/Services/Reviews/Contact Us</dd>	
	  <dt>Is there a Brand Identity/Style Guide to follow? Do you have colors, fonts, images or logos selected?</dt>
		<dd>Yes. Use logo. Royal Blue/Gold/White colors. No images other than the truck. Will need a new picture taken. Client will take and send at a later date. May need some photoshop clean up work.</dd>
	  <dt>Do you have any social media sites you like linked? If yes, please paste links into document.</dt>
		<dd>https://www.facebook.com/J-J-Repair-927770244015712/</dd>
		<dt>What language should this site be built in?</dt>
		<dd>English</dd>	

		<dt>What platform does the site need to be designed for? What is your primary target platform? How will this site need to be coded (programming/scripting languages, frameworks)?</dt>
		<dd>HTML. Bootstrap. JavaScript. JQuery.</dd> 
	   </dl>

	<h3>&nbsp;Other Things to Consider&nbsp;</h3>
	   <dl>
		<dt>Where will the site be hosted? How will updates be handled once project is completed?</dt>
		<dd>Customer's url is a go-daddy account. Updates will be handled by a third party (Dex) if any further work is to be completed. Customer currently has an advertising package deal with Dex, so they would just like the refresh of the page so they can hand off to the third party at no cost.</dd>

	  <dt>Will users need permissions or create an account to log in? Who will manage?</dt>
		<dd>No.</dd>	

		<dt>Do you plan on interacting with users through email, chat, blogging?</dt>
		<dd>No. Client perfers phone calls. However, I will be implementing a form for appointment requests for assignment purposes. I will give the client a chance to see it when completed and let them decide if they want that disabled after my class completion.</dd>	

		<dt>How will interactivity be accomplished (languages, technology)?	</dt>
		<dd>Again, client at this time is only interested in a refresh to the site. any customer needing heating or cooling repairs/replacements, electrical repair, water heater installs or small appliance work repaired. I will try to impliment a chat bot and want to incorporate a blog with cool tips and tricks that the client is using in Facebook in rotation as &quot;helpful hints.&quot;</dd>
		<dt>Will this site require using a database for customer information?</dt>
		<dd>No</dd>	

		<dt>Will this site require a payment handling system?</dt>
		<dd>No. But I do plan on showcasing payment methods accepted on the page as previously done.</dd>	

		<dt>Do you plan on having any Marketing Affiliates or ad space on this site?</dt>
		<dd>Currently Dex handles that.</dd>
	<dt>How will site tracking be handled?</dt><dd>Dex Knows will track as part of advertising package.</dd>
	   </dl>
