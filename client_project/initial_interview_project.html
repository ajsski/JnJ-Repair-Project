	<h1> Client Project - Analysis and Initial Interview Questions</h1>
	
<ol>
	<li>Who is the client?</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">J&J Repair</button>
<li>What need is being addressed, or what problem is being solved?</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Client would like to provide service oriented content to compete with local businesses and make it easier to find quick fixes on blog which owner's son will maintain once created.
			J&amp;J Repair provides services for installing and repairing all brands of major appliances, air conditioners and water heaters. J&amp;J Repair truck is a fully-stocked service truck to fix any problem. 
			<br>- Client is considering creating taking appointments online, but not in this round of refreshing the site.</button>
	<li>What is the big goal of the project?</li>	
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Web site was created by a student and pages are very dated and spelling errors everywhere. Site to educate and promote family business for the client.<br>- Client has no working HTML knowledge, but his son does.<br>- Has a current URL and a web server to host site.</button>
	
	<li>What are the basic components that will be required to solve the problem?</li>	
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Web site to be created mobile first. Pages to include: Home, About Us/Reviews, Contact Us, Quick tips/Possibly blog posts, Services Offered. Client would like current logo and very little images. Customer does not have stock photos at this time.</button>
	<li>What technologies will be used to solve the problem?</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Full stack- HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python/my SQL.
Possibly a blog later down the road (WordPress) for the author to continue content to help draw more readers.</button>

	<li>What is the time frame of the project?</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Novemeber 30, 2021</button>
	
	<li>What are the budget constraints or what resources are needed?</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Client would like to barter for redesigning/updating current pages. Since this is a homework assignment, I told client that I would be using this web page as a portfolio piece and asked if he would be comfortable with being a project referral.</button>

	<li>What are the major challenges of the project?</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Client has no web authoring experience (HTML, Python, etc.) and does not want to self-manage the site. All content must be accurate before going live. No content edits by developer will occur once launched. Project must go through interview process, final proofing and approval by key stakeholder before site content goes live. Any content updates after final deliverables will be handled by owner's son. </button>

	<li>Who are the key stakeholders/clients and members of the team?</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Key Stakeholder of project is Owner's of business John Milavec (JR). 
		<br>Additional Stakeholders of project and their roles as follows: 
		<br>Julie – (client/boss) also key source for interview questions. Julie has a firm knowledge basis regarding Key Stakeholder needs and wants. Source for any questions. Site reviewer.
		<br>
		Self – (team development, coder and designer of team) Responsible for Analysis, Wire-framing, Mockup, Initial site specifications, Draft of Site, Internal testing/proofing. Final Site development and deployment.</button>

 
	<li>Who is the target audience that the Key Stakeholder wants to reach?</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Any customer in need of heating or cooling repairs or replacements. Any customer's needing small appliance work repaired.</button>

	<li>Does the Key Stakeholder want a way for the visitor of this site to reach out and ask questions directly to author by email request form?</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Client is more interested in having customers call the business line directly. For sake of the project assignment I will be creating a form contact sheet.</button>

	<li>Does the Key Stakeholder have any thought on what they would like their website to look and feel like? Are there any examples of webpages they like the look or feel of another site?	</li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Customer just doesn't want page to look dated anymore. Spoke with client/boss Julie and agreed that making the page responsive is necessary in helping updating the look and feel. Wants page to be clean and approachable. "Quick tips" are currently being rotated on the company's Facebook page by admin tools. Client would like to see tips intergrated into the site refresh. </button>

	<li>Does the Key Stakeholder want to be able to track traffic or statics from their site through a backstage tool or maybe an email alert? For example, an impression or how long they stayed on the page, or did they click on to go to possibly purchase the new book, etc? </li>
		<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Key stakeholder is not interested. Client boss is interested in possibly doing some light tracking for email campaign purpose in the later future. Not as part of this project scope. Google analytics key will be provided. </button>
