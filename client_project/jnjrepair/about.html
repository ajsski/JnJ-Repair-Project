  <h2>Family owned and operated since 1976&nbsp;</h2>
 <p>For John Milavec, running a repair service came naturally to him.  His father started a repair business in 1976, and was a fixture in the St. Patrick's neighborhood of Joliet, repairing and maintaining the appliances, heating units and plumbing fixtures in many of the historical homes in the area. In fact, he was known as the "go-to guy," when it came to keeping the "old boilers running."  Not always an easy job. When John Senior retired in 2003, John took over the business and moved it to his home in Plainfield.  While John continues to work on older homes and can still keep those old boilers running, he constantly upgrades his skills with continuing education, and is up to date on all of the latest technologies in HVAC, electrical and plumbing.  He prides himself on getting the job done, doing it as quickly as possible and doing it right so that the equipment functions as it should without further problems.</p>
